"""Unified contraction/tracking metrics + wandb logging — single source of truth.

Every algorithm (PPO / SAC / C3M / C2RL / LQR / SD-LQR) and every path-tracking
environment reports the same four stability metrics, computed the same
memory-efficient *streaming* way — from per-env running accumulators only
(e0, e_last, e_max, running sum of error norms, step count) — never storing the
full ``(num_envs, T)`` error tensor:

  * ``auc``                — area under the normalized error curve e(t)/e(0),
                             dt-weighted trapezoidal rule.  Lower is better.
  * ``contraction_rate``   — empirical exponential rate ``lambda`` from the
                             endpoints: ``e(T) = e(0)·exp(-lambda·T·dt)`` ⇒
                             ``lambda = -ln(e_T / e_0) / (T·dt)`` (clamped ≥ 0).
                             Logged both as ``contraction_rate`` and the
                             user-facing alias ``lambda``.
  * ``running_lambda``     — whole-Episode rate, averaged over episodes that
                             contracted: per episode, ``ln(C_0/C_T)/T`` on the
                             normalized cost ``C = e/e(0)`` if the cost
                             decreased end-to-end; episodes that did not are
                             dropped from the average, not counted as 0. Only
                             from :class:`StatManagerEnvWrapper`, which has
                             the full per-step curve rather than just the
                             endpoints.
  * ``overshoot``          — peak normalized error ``e_max / e(0)`` (≥ 1 in
                             theory; a pure overshoot factor).
  * ``contraction_score``  — ``lambda / overshoot`` (higher = fast contraction
                             with little overshoot).
  * ``peak``               — distribution of per-episode peaks (``max_t
                             e(t)/e(0)``) across the env population, reported
                             as ``peak_mean``/``peak_median``/``peak_p95`` —
                             unlike ``overshoot`` (a single worst-curve
                             envelope constant ``C``), this is the actual
                             spread of how bad the worst moment gets. Only
                             from :class:`StatManagerEnvWrapper`.

``auc`` additionally reports order statistics across the env population —
``auc_median``/``auc_p05``/``auc_p25``/``auc_p75``/``auc_p95``/``auc_max``.
``auc_mean`` alone cannot separate "the whole population got worse" from "two
envs blew up": these envs never terminate, so a diverged env is pinned at the
position bound (``env_base.step``) while its reference drives away, and its
error — hence its AUC — grows for the remainder of the episode. One such env
lands orders of magnitude above a healthy ``~1.2``, which makes the mean a
de-facto count of blow-ups over the ``num_envs_for_eval`` slots. A flat median
under a thrashing mean is precisely that signature, and says the instability is
a rare-failure-rate problem rather than a degradation of typical tracking.

Each per-env quantity is reduced across the env population to a mean and a 95%
CI half-width (``1.96·SEM``, see :func:`mean_confidence_interval`); ``peak``
and the ``auc`` percentiles above are the exceptions.

Action volatility (see :meth:`StatManagerEnvWrapper._action_volatility_summary`)
is a separate smoothness diagnostic on the action stream, not a stability/
contraction metric — it is logged under ``Episode/*``, not ``Stability/*``.

The streaming AUC is exactly the trapezoid, not an approximation of it: with
``err_sum = Σ_{k=0}^{T-1} e_k`` at times ``t_k = k·dt``,

    ∫ e dt ≈ dt·(e_0/2 + e_1 + … + e_{T-1}/2) = dt·(err_sum − 0.5·e_0 − 0.5·e_last)

so the normalized AUC needs only ``err_sum``, ``e_0``, ``e_last`` — no curve.
Both endpoints get half weight; subtracting only ``e_0``, or worse adding
``e_last``, is the trapezoid-rule error earlier per-algorithm copies had.

Trajectory plots (``{prefix}/path_tracking``) show the policy rollout against
the whole reference path:

  * the rollout is recorded per step and ends when the episode does;
  * the reference is captured once per episode from the env itself
    (``get_reference_trajectory()``, present on both env families), not
    accumulated from the observation window.

The window is subsampled at ``ref_offset`` and truncated to the horizon, so a
reference rebuilt from it is an offset-dependent subsample of the real path —
the reference-window layout must never reach the logs. Consequently the two
curves have different lengths and each gets its own time axis.

The flat window layout is ``[urefs | x | xrefs]`` (``RefWindow.flatten``), so
the ``x`` block starts at ``length*u_dim`` — nonzero even for a length-1
window. ``_record`` slices past it and asserts the observation width matches
``ref_window.flat_dim``, because a layout drift here yields plots and metrics
that are wrong but entirely plausible-looking.

    The contraction results assume an optimal policy; training gives empirical
    convergence. This is the size of that assumption, measured rather than
    asserted -- and it is a real gap, not a Bellman residual: ``T^pi`` is a
    gamma-contraction with a unique fixed point for EVERY policy, so a
    perfectly-fitted critic on a terrible policy has zero residual and says
    nothing about optimality.

    ``V^pi`` is the realised discounted return of one episode, negated into the
    cost units V* is expressed in. With deterministic dynamics and the policy
    MEAN as the action that is not an estimate of V^pi, it IS V^pi -- no policy
    evaluation, no critic, nothing fitted. ``V*(x_0)`` is read off the offline
    grid by interpolation.

    The env's references are overwritten from the pack, because "same seed" is
    not an argument that two processes drew the same trajectories; if they did
    not, the difference is between a policy and the optimum of another problem.
