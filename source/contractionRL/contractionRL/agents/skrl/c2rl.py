"""C2RL — single-policy contraction-metric RL against a Neural Contraction
Metric (NCM) reward.

C2RLAgent trains one real skrl PPO/SAC sub-agent (per ``base_algorithm``)
against a Mahalanobis tracking reward

    ``tracking_scaler·(V_t - V_{t+1}) - control_scaler·||u||²``,   V = eᵀM(x)e

with ``e = x - xref``. The tracking term is the per-step decrease of ``V`` — a
contraction signal, not a level penalty — computed identically by both env
families. The control term is disabled (``control_scaler = 0``) in every
shipped config.

The env computes that reward from the frozen Phase-A CMG,
since the chosen object is injected into the env and called from its
``get_rewards()``:

  * "cmg" (default) — a CMG network ``W(x)`` synthesized in Phase A then frozen
    for the whole run (Tsukamoto's NCM recipe). Mandatory ``models["cmg"]``.


``cmg_method="ccm"`` trains the CMG directly with C1/C2 losses (no SDP),
so the pair is three real configurations, not four.

CMG training (``cmg_method``), both in ``ncm_synthesis.py``:

  * "cvstem" — sample ``cmg_memory_size`` states, solve one SDP per state for
    ``W*(x)`` (``build_cm_dataset``), MSE-regress the CMG onto the feasible
    ``{x -> W*}`` (``regress_cmg``). No differentiable certificate loss.
  * "ccm" — train the CMG directly on Manchester's C1 (contraction) and C2
    (killing) losses (``train_cmg_ccm``). No SDP, no regression.

Both require a ``BoundedCCM_Generator`` (hard eigenvalue bounds in the forward
pass, not a soft penalty); ``__init__`` raises otherwise, and ContractionRunner
always passes ``constrain_eigenvalues=True`` regardless of yaml.

States are drawn from the classic env's analytic state space (``get_rollout``,
unlimited) or, with ``dynamics_pretrain_data_path`` set, from that offline
``dynamics_data.npz`` (capped to its size, warning if it's short).

Phase b is identical across all three configurations: each hands off one object
with the same ``W, _ = metric(x)`` contract. The reward is never overwritten
agent-side — ``_inject_ccm`` puts that object in the env via ``set_ccm``, and
the env's own ``get_rewards()`` returns the Mahalanobis reward natively. So what
reaches ``record_transition`` (and thus PPO's GAE / SAC's replayed critic
target) is already correct, with no per-algorithm reward plumbing to keep in
sync. ``_inject_ccm`` raises if no env accepted it — silently missing it would
mean training on the plain baseline reward.

Normalization: the metric and reward always use raw observations. ``M(x)`` and
``e = x - xref`` are defined in physical coordinates, and per-dimension
normalization would scale ``x`` and ``xref`` independently, distorting ``e``.
``uref`` and ``angle_idx`` columns are likewise excluded (see
``rl_glue.make_base_rl_cfg``). ``use_state_norm`` is False in every config.

Learned dynamics (Isaac / ``use_empirical_dynamics``): a ``NeuralDynamics``
model supplies f/B/B_null and ∂f/∂x, pretrained once before Phase A. Under
"cmg" that is its only consumer (synthesis needs them; Phase B never touches it
again, the CMG being frozen). Under "online" the opposite — queried every step.
Classic envs use analytical ``get_f_and_B`` and skip pretraining.

        After pretraining π's mean is already near-optimal, so the true
        advantage is ~0 almost everywhere while the critic is still at random
        init. GAE divides by that near-zero advantage std, turning noise into a
        full-scale confident gradient the moment the critic produces its first
        coherent (but wrong) value landscape. A head start on the real return
        scale removes that source of the single destructive update.

        Rolls the frozen actor out in the real env for ``num_steps`` (the CMG
        must already be injected — the Mahalanobis reward is the fit target),
        computes each step's MC return discounting to the end of the window only
        (no bootstrap past it; negligible bias at this discount_factor, and a
        longer window shrinks it further), then MSE-regresses ``value`` onto it.

        ``_value_preprocessor`` is not bypassed. Its ``inverse=True`` path (what
        compute_gae uses) clamps to ±clip_threshold (default 5) Before scaling
        by sqrt(running_variance) — never an identity map for an output fit
        directly to MC-return scale, which here runs well past ±5. Regressing
        the raw output onto ``ret_all`` (an earlier version) meant the first
        live act() truncated most of the fitted landscape at the clamp, and the
        scale mismatch against the untouched running stats fed a runaway
        compute_gae: raw advantage std grew ~2 -> ~1e16 in one run while
        grad_norm_clip kept the policy bounded and the reward curve looked
        stable. So: fit the preprocessor's stats to ``ret_all`` once up front
        (one large representative batch, better calibrated than accumulating
        from tiny per-rollout ones), then regress onto the forward-standardized
        target in that same space. Network output and preprocessor stats then
