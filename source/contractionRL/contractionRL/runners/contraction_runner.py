"""ContractionRunner — single unified Runner for all algorithms × all envs.

Mirrors the skrl Runner interface::

    runner = ContractionRunner(env, cfg, task_id="Car-Direct-v0",
                               num_envs=4, is_classic=True)
    runner.run()

Algorithm routing
-----------------
PPO / SAC (and any other skrl-native algo):
    → skrl Runner  (skrl.utils.runner.torch.Runner)

C3M / LQR / SDLQR / C2RL-PPO / C2RL-SAC:
    → native skrl Agent subclasses (C3MAgent, LQRAgent, SDLQRAgent, C2RLAgent)
    with custom skrl Trainers (C3MSkrlTrainer, C2RLSkrlTrainer, or
    SequentialTrainer for eval-only analytical agents). C2RL-PPO/C2RL-SAC are
    the SAME C2RLAgent class — the algo string just selects which
    base_algorithm (PPO or SAC) its single deployed policy is built on. C2RL
    always synthesizes an offline, frozen CMG network (Neural Contraction
    Metric); ``cmg_method`` selects how it's trained ("ccm" C1/C2 loss
    minimization, or "cvstem" SDP regression). See _setup_c2rl.

Classic env: internally creates SyncVectorEnv + wrap_env.
Isaac env:   env is already a SkrlVecEnvWrapper — passed through.

Custom YAML flags handled here (stripped before passing to skrl)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
use_state_norm: true/false  →  observation_preprocessor
use_value_norm: true/false  →  value_preprocessor (PPO only)
anneal_log_std: true/false  →  exponential log_std schedule 0 → -20

    Two stages, and BOTH must pass:

       pos_x/pos_y pair plus a yaw and otherwise only recognised yaw-invariant
       dims -> SE(2); any pos_* dim -> translation; nothing -> none. An
       UNRECOGNISED name fails closed to translation rather than being assumed
       invariant.
    2. The candidate is CHECKED against the env's own dynamics -- translation
       needs f, B invariant; SE(2) needs them EQUIVARIANT (f(R.x) = R f(x)).
       A declaration is not a proof, and this is what catches e.g. the
       quadrotor, whose roll/pitch are world referenced so a yaw rotation mixes
       them: it is silently demoted to translation instead of mis-modelled.

    Envs with no analytical ``get_f_and_B`` (Isaac Sim) cannot be checked, so
    they keep the name-derived candidate but are capped at translation -- the
    conservative choice, since an unverifiable SE(2) claim would corrupt every
