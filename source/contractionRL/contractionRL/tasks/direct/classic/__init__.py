"""Classic (non-Isaac) analytical tracking environments.

Each subpackage registers a gym environment so it is discoverable by
``scripts/list_envs.py`` and runnable with ``scripts/skrl/train.py --classic``.

Importing this package registers every classic env. This works both as
``contractionRL.tasks.direct.classic`` (under Isaac) and as a standalone
``classic`` package on sys.path (no Isaac) — the registration
f-strings adapt to whichever package name they are imported under.

import warnings

# gymnasium reads the trailing -vN as a VERSION, so registering classic-car-v1
# makes it warn "classic-car-v0 is out of date, consider upgrading to v1" on
# every single car-v0 construction. That is wrong here and actively misleading:
# v0 and v1 are peers, two velocity boxes of one plant (v0 keeps v >= 1 where the
# Hautus margin sigma = min(1, v) is pinned at 1 and lambda* is constant; v1 opens
# it to v = 0.2 where sigma = v < 1 and lambda* becomes state-dependent). v0 is
# the baseline, not the obsolete one. Narrow filter, matched on this exact
# message, so a genuine gymnasium deprecation still reaches us.
