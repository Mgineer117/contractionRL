"""Shared divergence guard used by every env family (classic + Isaac).

A poor policy (random init, or an RL algorithm's early exploration) can drive
the dynamics to a non-finite (NaN/Inf) state. Every environment in this repo
must survive that without ending the rollout: contraction metrics (AUC,
overshoot, contraction rate) are fit over a FULL, fixed-length trajectory, so
an early termination on divergence would truncate exactly the data the
analysis needs. The fix used everywhere is the same: replace any non-finite
element with the corresponding element of the previous (last known-finite)
state, and keep stepping.
