"""The early-termination state box, shared by both env families.

``BaseEnv`` (classic, analytical) and ``PathTrackingBase`` (Isaac Lab) need
byte-identical semantics here — a contraction agent discovers
``set_terminate_out_of_box`` / ``terminate_out_of_box`` / ``X_TERMINATION_*``
by ``getattr`` and must not care which family it got (see CLAUDE.md's parity
rule). Keeping one implementation is the only way that stays true; two copies
drifted on the argument name alone within an hour of existing.

What the box is for
-------------------
An episode ENDS the first step the state leaves [X_TERMINATION_MIN,
X_TERMINATION_MAX]. Without it a diverged env keeps producing off-distribution
transitions for the rest of the horizon — on segway, 500 steps of already-fallen
data per failure — and those transitions dominate the rollout batch, which is a
large part of why that env's outcome swings with the seed.

Which done flag
---------------
The excursion is reported as TRUNCATION, not termination. skrl's GAE is
``not_done = ~terminated`` (agents/skrl/agent_patches.compute_gae), so
``terminated`` replaces the true continuation value V(x) with ZERO. Every reward
in this repo is a cost (V < 0), so that would make ending the episode strictly
better than continuing — a suicide bonus, which some seeds find and others do
not, i.e. exactly the variance the box exists to remove. On the truncation
channel with ``time_limit_bootstrap: true`` (set in every classic ppo/c2rl-ppo
yaml) skrl adds gamma*V(x_final) back and the agent is indifferent to the cut,
with no terminal penalty to tune. ``terminal=True`` opts into the other
behaviour and says loudly what it costs.
