"""W&B sweep trial wrapper that fails an INFEASIBLE trial fast, and loudly.

Why this exists
---------------
Several configs in ``search/configs/`` sweep the knobs that decide whether a
contraction SDP is solvable at all — the ``{w_lb, w_ub}`` envelope, ``λ``, ``ε``
and the Riccati ``R`` scaler, i.e. every term of

    A·W̄ + W̄·Aᵀ - 2ν·B R⁻¹Bᵀ + 2λ·W̄ ⪯ -ε·I,   ν ≤ 1/w_lb,  χ ≤ ν·w_ub

Large parts of that space are structurally infeasible (``ncm_synthesis.py``'s
module docstring measures 0% feasible on segway at ``w_lb=0.1``, 100% at
``w_lb=0.001``).

Left alone, an infeasible trial is the worst possible sweep outcome — not
because it fails, but because it fails WITHOUT A METRIC:

  * offline (C2RL cvstem): it either grinds through all 131072 per-state SDP
    solves before ``build_cm_dataset`` raises, or trains a full run on a CMG
    regressed onto a handful of surviving states.
  * online (CV-STEM-LQR): every infeasible state silently falls back to
    ``u = u_ref``, so the trial finishes with a plausible-looking AUC produced
    by a controller that was partly OPEN-LOOP.

Either way the sweep controller sees a run with no metric — and a metric-less
run is simply IGNORED by bayes bookkeeping. Nothing is learned from it, so the
same dead region gets sampled again, forever.

So this wrapper runs the trial as a child, watches its output, and the FIRST
time infeasibility is reported it kills the child, writes ``--bad-value`` to the
sweep metric, and exits 0. The trial becomes a real, very bad datapoint instead
of a hole — which is also what makes bayes usable over a partly-infeasible
space: the wall is an observation the surrogate can learn to avoid.

Nothing in the solver path is modified; detection is pure output inspection.
The configs pin the child to match this strictness:

    cm.max_lambda_reductions: 0      # no per-state λ-backoff papering over a miss
    cm.min_feasibility_rate:  1.0    # offline: child raises if ANY state is dropped
    cm.abort_on_infeasible:   true   # online: child raises on the FIRST miss

Detection signals:
  * ``CVSTEM-LQR INFEASIBLE``                            — the online abort
    (``cvstem_lqr.INFEASIBLE_MARKER``; the two must stay in sync)
  * tqdm postfix ``feasible=<k>/<i>`` with ``k < i``     — earliest offline signal,
    fires within the first 128 states
  * ``WARNING: state <i> infeasible at λ=...``           — λ-backoff rescue
  * ``NCM synthesis: <k>/<n> states feasible`` with k<n  — end-of-solve summary
  * ``produced 0 feasible metrics`` / ``below min_feasibility_rate`` — the raises

Run-id handling: the parent picks (or inherits) ``WANDB_RUN_ID`` and exports it
to the child, so after killing the child it can resume that exact run and write
the metric into its summary — which is the value the sweep controller reads.

Sign convention: ``--bad-value`` must match ``metric.goal``. For the AUC metrics
these configs use (MINIMIZED) it is a large positive number, not a negative one.

Usage (normally invoked by the sweep yaml search/build_sweep.py generates):
    python search/sweep_runner.py --task classic-car-v0 --algorithm cvstem-lqr \
        --num_envs 64 --metric-name "Stability/auc_mean" --bad-value=1e3 [...]
