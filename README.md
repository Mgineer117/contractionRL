# contractionRL

Contraction-based reinforcement learning. Eight algorithms — PPO, SAC, C3M, LQR, SD-LQR,
CV-STEM-LQR, C2RL-PPO, C2RL-SAC — run through one [skrl](https://github.com/Toni-SM/skrl)
backend across two environment families that share a single interface, so any algorithm trains and
evaluates on any environment and the reported stability metrics are directly comparable.

- **Classic envs** — pure NumPy/gymnasium, no simulator. Analytically synthesize a fresh reference
  trajectory every `reset()`. Twelve are registered (`car-v0`, `car-v1`, `cartpole`, `segway`,
  `quadrotor`, `aircraft`, `auv`, `ball_and_beam`, `pvtol`, `tora`, `two_link_arm`).
- **Isaac envs** — quadruped / humanoid / manipulator velocity- and path-tracking. Need Isaac Lab.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install -e source/contractionRL        # classic envs need nothing else
```

Isaac envs additionally need [Isaac Lab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/). The
contraction-metric SDP defaults to **SCS** (bundled with `cvxpy`); **MOSEK** is tighter and faster
if you have a license — put it at `~/mosek/mosek.lic` and set `cm_solver: MOSEK`.

```bash
python scripts/list_envs.py --keyword classic   # list envs without loading Isaac Sim
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Classic (no simulator). --num_envs is a process-level SyncVectorEnv.
python scripts/skrl/train.py --classic --task classic-car-v0 --algorithm c2rl-ppo --num_envs 4

# Isaac: pretrain locomotion on velocity-tracking, then do contraction control on path-tracking
python scripts/skrl/train.py --task Quadruped-VelTracking-v0  --algorithm ppo --num_envs 4096
python scripts/skrl/train.py --task Quadruped-PathTracking-v0 --algorithm c3m
# Isaac Sim runs headless by default; pass --headon to render a window.

# Evaluate / watch
python scripts/skrl/play.py --classic --task classic-car-v0

# Multi-seed with aggregated CIs, and hyperparameter sweeps
./commands/run_seeds.sh --algorithms c2rl-ppo --env car --seeds 10 --gpu 0 -y
./commands/search.sh --algorithm c3m --env all --gpu 0 -y
```

## Observation and action convention

Every path-tracking env, in both families, exposes the same gymnasium `Dict`:

```
obs = {x, xrefs, urefs}      xrefs[k] = xref[t + k*ref_offset],  k = 0 .. ref_length-1
```

`xrefs[0]`/`urefs[0]` are the current reference; the window is clamped at the episode end.
`agents/skrl/ref_window.py` owns this layout — `RefWindow.from_space` is how every model learns
its input shape, and `RefWindow.split` is the only code that knows the flat ordering skrl produces.

**Size `ref_length` to span the discount's effective horizon `1/(1-gamma)`.** A shorter window
makes the value function non-Markov, which is the POMDP the window exists to prevent;
`RefWindow.check_markov` warns when it happens.

**Actions:** every env applies `u_applied = action` directly — no env ever adds `uref` back in.
The *agent* folds it in: `CLActor` computes `urefs[0] + pi(s)`, LQR/SD-LQR compute
`urefs[0] - K·e`. Actor and critic are both exactly invariant to translating, and where the env is
SE(2) rotating, the whole scene.

**Never clip actions for a contraction controller.** `torch.clamp` has zero gradient at
saturation and silently collapses the certified feedback Jacobian. Use the tanh-squashed backbones
(`control-squashed` / `mlp-squashed`) when bounded actions are needed.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Learns | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| PPO / SAC | policy | Baselines. On path-tracking they default to the `control` backbone, so the policy mean is `uref + feedback`. |
| LQR | nothing | Constant-gain `u = uref - K·e` from a single linearization. |
| SD-LQR | nothing | Same, with `K(x)` recomputed per state. |
| CV-STEM-LQR | metric only | Tsukamoto's CV-STEM/NCM. One joint SDP over sampled states (shared `nu`, `chi`), fit `chol(W^-1)`, then deploy `u = uref - R^-1 B' M(x)·e`. No RL. |
| C3M | metric + policy | Jointly trains a Riemannian metric `W(x)` and a `CLActor` so all trajectories contract at rate `lambda`, alternating metric-only and controller-only steps on `pd_loss + c1_loss + c2_loss`. |
| C2RL-PPO / C2RL-SAC | policy | See below. |

### C2RL

One policy, two phases.

1. **Synthesize the metric, then freeze it.** `cmg_method: cvstem` solves one SDP per sampled
   state and regresses the metric network onto `{x -> W*}`; `ccm` instead trains it directly on
   Manchester's C1/C2 losses (no SDP — required for a driftless plant, which is
   CV-STEM-infeasible at every `lambda`). The `cvstem` solve is expensive, so its result is cached
   under `data/` and the agent **refuses to run** rather than silently re-solve when no cached
   dataset matches the config.
2. **Ordinary PPO/SAC against that frozen metric,** on the reward
   `tracking_scaler·(V_t - V_{t+1}) - control_scaler·||u||^2`, with `V = e'M(x)e`. The tracking
   term is the per-step *decrease* of `V` — a contraction signal, not a level penalty.

The **environment** computes that reward: `_inject_ccm` hands the frozen metric to the env via
`set_ccm` and the env's own `get_rewards()` returns it, so PPO's GAE and SAC's replayed critic
target are correct with no per-algorithm reward plumbing. `_inject_ccm` raises if no env accepted
the metric — quietly training on the plain baseline reward instead would be invisible in every
metric.

The deployed law is `u = urefs[0] + pi(s)` with `pi = W2(xrefs)·tanh(W1(x)·e)`. There is no
analytic base controller in the loop and no certificate-based warm start of `pi`.

The metric and the reward always use **raw** observations: `M(x)` and `e = x - xref` are physical
quantities, and per-dimension normalization would scale `x` and `xref` independently, distorting
`e`. `use_state_norm` is `false` in every shipped config.

## Metrics

Every algorithm reports the same four `Stability/*` metrics — AUC, contraction rate `lambda`,
overshoot, and contraction score (rate/overshoot) — through one code path
(`agents/skrl/contraction_metrics.py`), which is what makes numbers comparable across algorithms and env
families. C2RL additionally reports the `Stability_maha/*` twins computed under its own metric.

When **no** episode in a round survives to be measured, `stability_summary()` publishes only
`Stability/early_end_frac` rather than a stale AUC. Seeing that key alone is the diagnostic, not a
logging bug.

**Termination.** Each env declares a certified box `[X_TERMINATION_MIN, X_TERMINATION_MAX]`, and by
default an episode ends the first step the state leaves it. The excursion is reported as
**truncation, not termination**: skrl's GAE uses `not_done = ~terminated`, so flagging it
terminated would zero the continuation value — and since every reward here is a cost, ending early
would then be strictly better than continuing. On the truncation channel with
`time_limit_bootstrap: true` the agent is indifferent to the cut. `cartpole` and `segway` ship with
the box **disabled**: both are unstable plants started far from the reference, so with it armed
every episode ended within a few steps and no stability metric could be computed at all.

## Configuration

One yaml per (env, algorithm), next to the env: `tasks/direct/<env>/agents/skrl_<algorithm>_cfg.yaml`.

**A yaml key that is not a declared field of the algorithm's `Cfg` dataclass is not applied.**
`rl_glue.filter_cfg_fields` warns loudly rather than dropping it silently, because a run with an
ignored key trains a different algorithm than its config describes and looks completely healthy.
Add the dataclass field alongside any new yaml knob.

Sweeps go through `commands/search.sh`; the searched space lives in `search/configs/<algorithm>.yaml`
and applies to every env, so the script itself never needs editing.

## Contributing and CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `ruff` restricted to bug classes (style is left to `pre-commit`,
since import order is load-bearing on the Isaac route) plus one short end-to-end training run per
algorithm on `classic-car-v0`. That smoke run is the check that catches what imports cannot: a
config key that stops being applied still imports fine. Nothing in CI needs Isaac Sim.

The unit suite runs without Isaac Sim too: `python -m pytest tests -q`. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the invariants each test enforces.
