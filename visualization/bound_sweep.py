"""Feature 3 — error_geometry.py's control-space geometry, one panel per w_lb/w_ub pair.

This IS error_geometry.py with one axis swapped. That script holds the bounds
fixed and gives a panel to each SYNTHESIS OBJECTIVE (ccm vs cvstem_pretrained vs
cvstem_online vs random); this one pins the objective to ``cmg_method="ccm"``
(ncm_synthesis.train_cmg_ccm — the C1/C2 contraction losses, no SDP, no
regression) and gives a panel to each ``[w_lb, w_ub]`` eigenvalue envelope.
Everything else — the trunk, the control grid, the lookahead, the normalization,
the figures — is unchanged, so the panels differ by the envelope and nothing else.

Leading them is a EUCLIDEAN panel (M = I, --no-euclidean to drop it): no metric
at all, the naive geometry every conditioned panel is a departure from. It costs
one landscape and turns "is this basin the metric's doing?" from a judgement call
into a comparison on screen. Note where it sits on the axis the envelopes are
spread along: cond(M) = 1, BELOW even the tightest envelope's ceiling of 3 — it
is the isotropy those envelopes are clamping the C1/C2 fit toward.

Each envelope gets its OWN C1/C2 fit from the same config, over the same states,
cached separately. The panel is therefore the metric c2rl would actually deploy
at those bounds, not a rescaling of one fit: w_lb/w_ub enter
BoundedCCM_Generator's forward pass as hard sigmoid eigenvalue bounds
(nn_modules.py), so they shape what the fit can even represent, and refitting
under each is the only faithful way to show them.

Why this exists: C2RL is very sensitive to w_lb/w_ub (works at 0.5/1.5, badly
elsewhere) while the normalized-error curves show little difference. Those curves
are √(eᵀMe / e₀ᵀMe₀), which is INVARIANT to M → c·M — blind to the metric's scale
by construction, and CV-STEM's SDP even solves for a scale-normalized W̄ ⪰ I with
the scale parked in ν (ncm_synthesis.solve_cm_metric). The landscapes here are
built from the same normalized quantity, so read them as the geometry the bounds
produce — the shape of the basin, where its optimum sits, how sharp it is — not
as a scale comparison, which no panel in this file can show.

At each trunk state, EVERY control in the actuator box is HELD for --lookahead H
steps and the resulting error measured, exactly as in error_geometry.py:

    error(u, k) = sqrt( e'^T M(x') e' / e0^T M(x0) e0 ),  e' = wrap(x' - xref_{k+H})

  * u_dim == 1 (cartpole, segway) -> static t x u x error surface per envelope (.svg)
  * u_dim == 2 (car, turtlebot)   -> MP4: u0 x u1 x error surface per envelope per
                                    timestep, with --history translucent shells

The trunk (--trunk, viz_common.trunk_states) is COMMA-SEPARATED, one output file
per trunk (default: uref,cvstem_lqr,greedy), and within each file it is ALWAYS
one trunk shared by every panel:

  * ``cvstem_lqr`` — that analytical controller's trajectory. Metric-independent,
    and stays in the well-tracked region a real controller occupies.
  * ``uref`` — zero feedback. The only fully algorithm- AND metric-independent
    choice, at the cost of a trunk whose error grows unchecked (car: |e| 0.819 →
    9.892) into a region no working controller would visit.
  * ``greedy`` — best control on the grid, metric-DEPENDENT, so ONE designated
    envelope drives the trunk for every panel (--trunk-bounds); letting each panel
    follow its own metric would put them on different trajectories and their
    differences would no longer be attributable to the envelope alone.

Measured on car (seed 42), worth knowing before reading a panel: the C1/C2 fit
wants cond(M) ≈ 45-47 under every envelope, so 0.5:1.5 sits PINNED against its
box (realized 2.99 of a permitted 3) while 0.1:10 is not binding at all (46.6
inside a box of 100). The tight envelope is the one actively clamping the metric
toward isotropy — that is the difference these panels are drawing.

Classic envs only. Standalone: nothing in the training code depends on this.

Examples:
    python visualization/bound_sweep.py --env car     # 3 envelopes x 3 trunks
    python visualization/bound_sweep.py --env car --bounds 0.5:1.5,0.1:10
    python visualization/bound_sweep.py --env car --trunk uref
