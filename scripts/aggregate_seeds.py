"""Aggregate multi-seed best-policy evaluations into a single CSV.

Each training run writes ``eval_results.json`` next to its checkpoints — the
best_agent.pt rollout produced by train_utils._evaluate_best_model /
_evaluate_classic_path_tracking. That file already holds the Stability numbers
for ONE seed (auc, overshoot C, contraction rate lambda, contraction score,
total reward), plus the run identity written by train_utils._run_metadata.

This script collects those per-seed files and reduces them across seeds,
emitting two CSVs:

  * ``<out>_runs.csv``    one row per seed — the raw per-run numbers.
  * ``<out>.csv``         one row per (task, algorithm) — mean, std and 95% CI
                          across seeds, plus n_seeds.

The two CI columns mean different things and are deliberately both kept:
``*_ci95`` inside a run is the within-run CI over that run's eval episodes,
while ``*_ci95`` in the summary is the across-SEED CI — the one that answers
"is this algorithm better", since seeds are the independent samples. The
per-seed value fed into the summary is each run's ``*_mean``.

Usage:
    python scripts/aggregate_seeds.py --run-tag seeds_20260720_120000
    python scripts/aggregate_seeds.py --logs logs --out results/my_table
