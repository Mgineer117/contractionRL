    vectorized-boundary bookkeeping: a plain loop over ONE env instance, one

    Reports mean +/- 95% CI of total reward, error AUC, and overshoot C /

    episodes), fine as an end-of-training report but dead weight in a sweep: it
    does not feed the sweep metric at all (that ``Stability/auc_mean`` comes
