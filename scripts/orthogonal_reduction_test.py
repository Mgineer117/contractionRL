"""Orthogonal Reduction Test: is an env's certified contraction rate uniform?

The proposition. If there is a map T : X -> O(n) and a FIXED pair (A0, B0) with

    T(x) A(x) T(x)^T = A0,      T(x) B(x)B(x)^T T(x)^T = B0 B0^T      for all x,

then lambda*(x) = lambda*_0 everywhere: the congruence Wbar -> T(x) Wbar T(x)^T
carries the per-state problem onto one fixed problem, and the underlying
condition is orthogonally invariant, so feasibility is identical at every x.
Contrapositive, which is what this script is for: a state-dependent rate can
only arise when NO such reduction exists.

Two halves, because they prove different things.

1. INVARIANTS (necessary). Every trace of a word in {A, A^T, M := BB^T} is
   invariant under the joint congruence, as are the spectra of A, of sym(A), and
   of M, and A's singular values. If any of them moves with x, no T can exist --
   and this is a certificate of NON-reducibility, not a heuristic: one varying
   invariant rules out every T at once.

2. CONSTRUCTION (sufficient, up to numerics). When the invariants hold still,
   that alone does not produce a T, so this actually solves

       min over T in O(n) of  ||T A(x) T^T - A0||_F^2 + ||T M(x) T^T - M0||_F^2

   at each sampled x, with (A0, M0) read off a reference state. T is
   parametrized as Q expm(S) with S skew and Q in {I, reflection}, covering both
   components of O(n), with restarts. A residual at machine-noise level across
   every sample is the reduction exhibited; a floor well above it means the
   invariants agreed by coincidence at the sampled order and the test is
   inconclusive rather than positive.

A(x) here is the drift Jacobian df/dx, which is exactly what
``figures/data/minproj_<env>.npz`` was computed from -- so the verdict and the
measured lambda* spread it is checked against describe the same object. The CM
LMI that ships uses the generalized Jacobian A(x,u) at the u-box vertices; the
reduction question for that object needs the vertex set carried through, and is
not what this script answers.
