"""Which states cap the uniform λ, and what a subset buys you if you drop them.

``find_uniform_lambda`` answers "what λ holds over the whole box". This answers
the follow-up: **which samples are the ones holding it down**, and how much
faster the rate gets on a subset that excludes them.

Two modes, because there are two defensible ways to pick that subset and they
answer different questions::

    --mode certificate   read the binding states off the SDP, shrink away from
                         exactly them. Maximum λ gain per unit volume removed.
                         Diagnostic: tells you what the certificate is limited by.

    --mode tube          nest by tube radius around the reference. The subset the
                         closed loop actually visits, so it is not chosen to
                         flatter the number. Deployment claim.

Why both MODES use nested *Sample* Sets
---------------------------------------
λ_max over a smaller set is mathematically ≥ λ_max over a larger one — fewer
constraints, larger feasible set. Draw fresh i.i.d. samples per level and that
guarantee evaporates: each level estimates its own box's worst case from its own
finite draw, so a smaller box can draw a nastier point than its parent did and
the curve goes down. Measured on cartpole with no envelope, N=100 per level:
λ = 4.89, 8.86, 13.31, 11.02, 11.08 — the drop at level 3 is pure resampling
noise, and it is indistinguishable by eye from a real effect.

So both modes draw once at the top and filter. Level k's samples are a literal
subset of level k-1's, monotonicity holds by construction, and any increase is
signal. The cost is depth: an isotropic 0.6 shrink in d active dims keeps 0.6^d
of the points per level, so ``--num-samples`` has to be large enough that the
deepest level still has enough left (``--min-samples`` enforces it).

What "binding" means here
-------------------------
``cvstem_joint`` returns only ``{W, nu, chi, J}`` — no duals. It does not need
to: every constraint is reconstructible from the solution. For each sample::

    W̄_k = W_k·ν
    S_k  = (W̄_k - I)/dt + A_k W̄_k + W̄_k A_kᵀ + 2λW̄_k - ν(2/r)B_k B_kᵀ

and the program asked for ``S_k ⪯ -εI``. So ``-ε - λ_max(S_k) ≥ 0`` is the LMI
slack, and the samples with slack ≈ 0 are the ones the rate is resting on.

The envelope constraints ``I ⪯ W̄_k ⪯ χI`` are reported the same way, and that
distinction is the whole point: if the tight samples are tight on the LMI, the
state box is what caps λ and shrinking it will help. If they are pinned against
χI instead, the deployment envelope is the cap, and no amount of shrinking moves
the number — measured on the car, where λ_max was 2.1183 at every nesting level
of a 5-level shrink, but ≥40 with the envelope dropped.
